# Example Worker Service

This is an example service implementing the circuit breaker pattern for my article [Implementing Circuit Breaker Pattern](https://taborsky.cz/posts/2018/implementing-circuit-breaker-pattern/).

Two versions are provided:

- `without-cb.js` - you guessed it... it's the service without circuit breaker implemented
- `with-cb.js` - do I even have to write this?
